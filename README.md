## Instructions for use

#### To Encode
- Enter the text you want to hide in the first box
- Enter an optional mask text 
- Press encode button
- Press Copy, and you have the encrypted text in your clipboard
#### To Decode
- Enter the encrypted text into the first box
- Press decode, and there you have it 

## How this works?

#### Encoder
- First it takes the text to encode and splits it into characters.
- It then takes each character and converts it into unicode.
- The unicode is then converted to 8-bit binary code.
- Then, for each 1 and 0 it returns a zero-width character ie '\u200B' and '\u200C' respectively.
- Finally, it joins all these into a string, places '\uFEFF' in between and returns it.

#### Decoder
- Firstly, it splits the given string into an array using '\uFEFF'
- Now, it changes zero-width characters into binary by replacing 1,0 for every '\u200B' and '\u200C' respectively.
- Then it converts these binary codes into integer
- The integers are then converted to character.
- And lastly, the characters are then joined to make the final string.
